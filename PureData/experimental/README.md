## experimental patches

these are unreleased, unsupported, incomplete, untested and probaby not working... 

they are of no interest to anyone except me ;) 

they exist here as temporary backups, whilst i develop ideas and concepts.
these ideas / concepts are not fully thought thru, and will change before release

SO... Id seriously recommend ignoring, anything you find here ... wait till the ideas feature in a release ;)
